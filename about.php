			<h3> About </h3>
			<p> Greetings, Im Mr.McNeill. This is my design portfolio. All work featured here was composited/designed by me during my course work in college. Nothing here has/is being sold for profit but is merely here to showcase my talents. Additionally, as I grow in the areas of Web Design/Development I'd like to visually track my progress. Thanks for visiting. Share with friends if you'd like. </p>
