				<p> We Are 1 Family was a student organization that I was a part of during my collegiate career. Throughout my tenure I was tasked with creating flyers, tickets, ads, etc. that represented the organization as well as targeted various demographics in order to generate support for event that the organization held. All projects were used as both digital and print mediums. </p>
