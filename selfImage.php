				<p> This particular project we were presented a challenge where we needed to re-create ourselves using techniques such as cloning, burning, dodging, etc. With our professor's philosophy of starting with the most difficult task first, we were asked to accurately recreate ourselves in the likes of a chosen image without tainting the natural look of skin/hair. (First image is the final design while the last is the original image.) </p>
